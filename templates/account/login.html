      <p class="lead pt-5">
          Local Library Uganda was built with love by Ojok Simon Peter to help his friends and other students studying at any Higher 
          Institute of Learning to meet their academic document requirements.Local Library bridges 
          you with other students who are doing and have done the same course you are currently doing, 
          since you are also following the same path, you will be able to get and use all their materials 
          they have uploaded for you.You can also upload your own documents so other students can also you them.
          Please take time and create account to see what other students doing the some program like you are reading..<br>
          Happy studying ..... Simon Peter Ojok
